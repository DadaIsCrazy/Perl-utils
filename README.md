# Perl-utils
Some perl script/modules :

light_copy :
  This script takes 2 directory names as paramters,  and copy the structure of the 1st one into the 1nd one.
  Directories content and file names will be copy, but files contents wont be.

check_same_dir:
  This script takes 2 directory names as parameters, and check for differences between these directories : 
  missing files, missing sub-directories, or different content in files.
